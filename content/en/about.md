## About me

I was born in a small mountain village in Jiangxi in 2000. I started studying at Northeastern University in Shenyang in 2018. My major during undergraduate studies was Internet of Things Engineering, and I mainly focused on XCPC competitions. In 2022, I was admitted to Southeast University (Nanjing). I was not good at scientific research and projects during my graduate studies. I am currently looking for an internship related to C++ backend. You can contact me by sending me an email at yuanyanghao2022@163.com

## About this site

Since I was admitted to graduate school, I found that I have lost the ability to concentrate for a long time and the ability to learn knowledge in depth and system, which makes me anxious and distressed. I hope to record my learning and life process in the form of pictures and texts to motivate myself to keep learning.
